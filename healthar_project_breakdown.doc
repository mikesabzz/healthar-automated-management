1. Manual Task: Post ERA (Explanation):

- ERA stands for Electronic Remittance Advice, which is essentially an electronic document that healthcare 
providers receive from insurance companies explaining the payments made for medical services. Posting ERA 
involves recording these payments and updating patient records accordingly.

2. Automated Tasks (Explanation):

- Updating Patients' Balances: When an ERA is posted, it often includes information about the payments 
made by insurance. So, the patient's balance needs to be updated based on this information.
- Creating Patients' Invoices: Invoices need to be generated for the patients based on the services provided 
and the payments received.
- Charging Credit Cards (if stored): If patients have their credit card information stored, the system should 
automatically charge the appropriate amount.
- Sending Text Messages to Patients: Patients should be notified via text message that their statement has been updated.

Frontend (React):

1. Create React App: Set up a new React project using create-react-app.
2. Components:
- Create components for posting ERA, updating patient balances, creating invoices, charging credit cards, and sending text messages.
- Each component will handle its specific task and interact with the backend API.
3. API Calls:
- Use fetch or axios to make HTTP requests to the backend API endpoints.
- For example, when posting ERA, the frontend will send a POST request to the backend with the ERA data.
4. User Interface:
- Design user-friendly interfaces for each task using libraries like Material-UI or Bootstrap.
- Ensure smooth navigation between different components.

Backend (Express):

1. Set Up Express Server: Initialize a new Express project.
2. Routes:
- Create routes for handling different tasks such as posting ERA, updating balances, creating invoices, charging credit cards, 
and sending text messages.
- Define appropriate HTTP methods (POST, GET, etc.) for each route.
3. Controllers:
- Implement controller functions for each route to process incoming requests and perform necessary actions.
- For example, when receiving a request to post ERA, the controller will update patient balances and create invoices.
4. Database Interaction:
- If data needs to be stored, interact with a database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) to store patient information, payment details, etc.
5. Integration:
- Integrate with external services for tasks like charging credit cards and sending text messages.
- Use libraries or APIs provided by payment gateways and SMS service providers for this purpose.
